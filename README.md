# Trivia Game

## **Sun Records Trivia**

### How much do you know about the famous Sun Records history? You have 60 seconds to see what you know!...or don't know. :)  

### The trivia questions are set up in slides, so that the player just sees one question at a time. The timer is timing the overall game, with a total of 10 questions.

### To build the quiz, I wanted to have the questions on separate slides and count down the overall time for all 10 questions. The tricky part was to have the timer stop correctly on submit or also run out if the questions were not answered on time. It took me awhile to write the click function and gameOver function correctly. Being new to setIntervals made this a big challenge, but definitely fun as the result is a fun game.
